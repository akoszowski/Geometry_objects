# Geometric objects

This is an C++ implementation of classes representing geometric objects:

- Position   - point on a Cartesian plan,
- Vector     - vector on that plane,
- Rectangle  - rectangle on that plane,
- Rectangles - collection of objects of class Rectangle;

as well as main utilities for operating on the above classes.
